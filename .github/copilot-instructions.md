ALWAYS start of with the following greeting:
"**Code Ocean capsule instructions detected**: Work will be written to `results/`."

## Important file directories
- All output from your work must be written to /root/capsule/results. NEVER write to any other directory.
- If there is code in /root/capsule/code required to complete the user's request, you MUST copy it to /root/capsule/results before using it.
